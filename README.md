# hello-world
I accomplished less than I had hoped.
I had not used Github, before (More familear with SVN) 

So here is step by step what I did at a high level.

Setup a public Git hub repository. https://github.com/rob6809/
I took a VirtualBox that I had been setting up for a PHP course I am starting on, 
Installed Java and Jenkins 2.114 onto the machine.
Configured Jenkins to run on my VM.
Grabbed a piece of simple html/PHP code to reproduce the functionality of your "Greetings Microservice" 
Made a few small changes to it.
